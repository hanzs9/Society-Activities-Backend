### Background, aims and objectives

Several students have difficulty in finding and joining their favorite society activities expediently and the administrators of each society may also not have the identical way to manage their members. Therefore, the purpose of the Society Management System is to manage miscellaneous activities organized by different societies and administer the society members in University of Liverpool, thereby enhancing the efficiency of management and the convenience of students.###  Anticipated components of the system

There are three components compromising the whole system, which are the application, the server and the database. The server plays the role as a middleware between the mobile application and the database. The operations of the phone are just posting the requests and receiving the data from the server. The connection between the application and the server can be achieved through WiFi. Afterwards, most of the manipulation will be carried out in the server, such as the algorithm for sorting recommendations. Database has been used to store the information about the students, administrators and supervisors, including the account details of the various actors, the specific contents of the different activities, the applications for joining the society and so on. Sever can use the way of “key-value” to find the required information in the database.
